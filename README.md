# HADO README

### Simulation code to run Hierarchical Adaptive Design Optimization (Cavagnaro, Myung, Pitt, NIPS 2009) with the experience-based learning paradigm.

People first engage in a classification learning task and subsequently in a information acquisition task. This code only works for the 3 category / 2 binary feature case. Our goal is to infer which model (=> set of three parameters, two parameters specifying degree/order of Sharma-Mittal entropy measure and one parameter associated with the response function) best describes participants behavior. This particular instance of the code only works for a binary response, i.e., subjects either prefer the first or the second feature.

In running simulations we are particularly interested in two use cases:
- Use case 1: We want to run full simulation studies over many stages, simulating sequential responses for particular combinations of degree/order/response beta.
- Use case 2: We want to perform Design Optimization (DO) for a particular prior (our current belief) to determine which experiment (design) to run next 

We can either run a full, multi-stage simulation, or specify prior and/or design and only run a single HADO step. To exectute these commands, no installation is necessary, just download and copy the repository to a local folder.

The code enables us to do both of these things by executing the python script in the main folder, run_ado.py, in some of the following ways:

```
python run_ado.py --config=config.txt --full --seed=123
```

```
python run_ado.py --config=config.txt --seed=123 --stage=2 --prior=data/test/hado_sid_0_stage_001_prior.npy
```

```
python run_ado.py --config=config.txt --seed=123 --stage=4 --prior=data/test/hado_sid_0_stage_003_posterior_0.npy --design=data/test/hado_sid_0_stage_004_design.npy
```

## Running simulations

In general, execution follows this format:

```
python run_ado.py [Options]
```

**With the following options available:**

```
--config=path to config file
```
	
	Use the config flag to specify the path to the configuration file (a simple text file, see more details below) that contains the arguments for ado initialization.

```
--seed=number
```

	Optionally use a particular random seed for reproducibility.

```
--full
```
	
	Use the 'full' flag to run a full simulation with the arguments specified in the config file. None of the remaining three arguments will have an effect if full simulations are run. Otherwise (if the 'full' flag is omitted), the script will run a stepwise simulation.


<hr \>

**Only for stepwise simulations:**

```
--stage=number
```

	The current experimental stage.

```
--prior=path to prior file (format: npy)
```

	Specify a custom belief (prior) to be used in the current experimental stage.

```
--design=path to design file (format: npy)
```

:	Specify a custom design used to simulate the response. Specification of both prior and design for the current experimental stage are optional. If no prior is specified, use the prior in the config file. If no design is specified, perform DO with the optimization method specified in the config file to search for a design.


## The config file

All other important parameters are specified in a text file that is passed before execution using the config flag. A variety of parameters can be set. Here is an example from the current config file:

```
true_order=7
true_degree=5
true_beta=0
betaSpace=[1]
granularity=4
method='mcmc'
prior='rand'
N_categories=3
N_features=2
max_steps=3
n_trials=1
learnability=True
logging=True
plotting=False
save_results=True
filename='jonathan_test/hado_sid_0_stage_'
parallelize=True
n_designs=10
n_iterations=1
```

The config file can contain any number of those parameters. If omitted, they will fall back to their default values (specified in brackets). Parameters can be grouped according to the following categpories:

**Model parameters, parameter space (order, degree, beta)**

	granularity = 1|4 (1) //of logxlog grid, by default 13x13
	betaSpace
	true_beta=index to array, default uniform sample (specifies an index)
	true_order=7
	true_degree=5
	true_beta
	prior = uni|exp|rand

**Experimental design parameters:**

	N_categories=3
	N_features=2
	n_trials=1

**DO parameters (incl. method-specific optimization arguments)**
	
	method='mcmc'
	learnability=True
	max_steps=3
	parallelize=True
	n_designs=10
	n_iterations=1


**Misc parameters**

	logging=True
	plotting=False
	save_results=True
	filename='test/hado_sid_0' #will automatically add _stage_ at the end!!
	it is recommended to separate parameters and values by underscore, e.g. history_0101011 (for history of responses)

Filepath and filename: Specify a custom filepath and name to save the simulation results, relative to the main folder. All results (plots/designs/beliefs) will be saved in data // logs will be saved in logs
